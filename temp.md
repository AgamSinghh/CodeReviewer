❌ Bad Code:
```javascript
function sum(a, b) {return a + b + c;}
```

🔍 Issues:
* ❌ `c` is not defined within the scope of the function. This will likely result in an error (e.g., `ReferenceError: c
is not defined`) when the function is executed.
* ❌ The function is simple, but the presence of an undefined variable makes it non-functional as is.

✅ Recommended Fix:

```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
return a + b;
}
```

💡 Improvements:

* ✔️ Removed the undefined variable `c`, so the function now correctly returns the sum of `a` and `b`.
* ✔️ The function now serves its intended purpose without causing an error.

Alternatively, if `c` was intended to be a third parameter:

```javascript
function sum(a, b, c) {
return a + b + c;
}
```

💡 Improvements:

* ✔️ Added `c` to the function signature, making it a defined parameter.
* ✔️ The function now correctly sums three variables.

Final Note:

Always ensure that all variables used within a function are either defined as parameters or declared within the
function's scope to prevent errors and ensure the code works as expected.
